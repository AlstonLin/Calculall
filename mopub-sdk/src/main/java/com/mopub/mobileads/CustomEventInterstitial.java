 * support a wider variety of third-party ad networks, or execute any of your application code on
 * demand.
 * 
 * At runtime, the MoPub SDK will find and instantiate a CustomEventInterstitial subclass as needed
 * and invoke its loadInterstitial() method.

     * an interstitial ad from a third-party ad network, or execute any application code.
     * It must also notify the provided CustomEventInterstitial.Listener Object of certain lifecycle
     * events.

     * MoPub website that you want to associate with a given custom event request. This data may be
     * used to pass dynamic information, such as publisher IDs, without changes in application code.
