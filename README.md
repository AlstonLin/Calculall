An Android Calculator app that does all

This is an Android Application created by TruTech Innovations Inc.<br>
###Description
At TruTech Innovations, we believe that our phones, with superior processing power, should take over the antiquated technology of expensive and inconvenient scientific and graphing calculators. With these ideals, we decided to create Calculall, an Android Application that brings all of the features of a Graphing Calculator, and more, onto your phone. We spent over a year developing and refining to make this calculator to be the most beautiful, effective and efficient tool to use for assisting in any mathematical problems, from finding the most complex indefinite integral, to simple everyday calculations.
